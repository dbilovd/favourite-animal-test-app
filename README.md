Because of time-constraint I didn't add any test


## Process

![alt text](notion-notes.png "Notion notes")

The first thing I did was to go through the document and list all the features that must be covered by the solution.

After this, I setup my environment. Installed and configured all the tools I needed.

After this, I implemented a bare version of these functionalities inside the page `page.js` file.

I then refactored some of these functionalities into smaller components

My final task was working on the design and cleaning up the appearance.


### There are a few bugs, including a user can both like and dislike a character. But with more time, I would have spent some of it writing tests for the app.
